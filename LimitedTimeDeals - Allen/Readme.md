**Problem Statement**
* You happen to be a budding entrepreneur and you have come up with an idea to build an e-commerce giant like Amazon, Flipkart, Walmart, etc. As part of this ambition, you want to build a platform to duplicate the concept of Limited Time Deals.

<b>Limited Time Deals</b>
* A limited-time deal implies that a seller will put up an item on sale for a limited time period, say, 2 hours, and will keep a maximum limit on the number of items that would be sold as part of that deal.
* Users cannot buy the deal if the deal time is over
* Users cannot buy if the maximum allowed deal has already been bought by other users.
* One user cannot buy more than one item as part of the deal.

The task is to create APIs to enable the following operations
* Create a deal with the price and number of items to be sold as part of the deal
* End a deal
* Update a deal to increase the number of items or end time
* Claim a deal

**Guidelines**

* Document and communicate your assumptions in README.
* Create a working solution with production-quality code.
* Define and Create APIs to support the operations mentioned above
* Write a few unit tests for the most important code

**What are we looking for?**
* Your approach to the solution
* How you write code in terms of readability and maintainability
* Usage of best practices
* Testing skills
